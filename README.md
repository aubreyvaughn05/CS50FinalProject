Welcome to "Can I Have This Dance?"! This is a Dance Collaboration Platform that goes beyond geographical boundaries, providing features for sharing dance videos,offering feedback, and collectively see and learn about other dancers around the world. With an emphasis on enhancing the collaborative experience, this project integrates technology to revolutionize the way dancers collaborate and create.

- Register:
    First, you must register for an account, then you will be redirected to the log-in page. Once you log-in, you will be redirected to your profile page where you add thing to your profile like your name (you will need to reuse your name for collaboration purposes, so try to make it easier to remember), position, experience, and etc. You can only press done after you have entered information into all of the fields. After you press the "done" button, you should see your updated profile, so all the dancers on "Can I Have This Dance?" can see your profile now.

- Homepage:
    Now, let's explore the platform's features! There are 6 tabs on the navigation bar at the top: homepage, search, collab, playlists, share, and messages. Starting with the homepage (pressing on the "Can I Have This Dance?" tab), you will see ALL of the videos that dancers have uploaded to the site (including yours if you decide to upload videos). While you are able to watch each video, you can also add the video to a playlist by clicking on the add to playlist button. You wiil be redirected to a page where you can select which playlist you want the video to go to. You can only add a video to ONE playlist.

- Users Profiles:
    If you decide to press on a username under a video, you will be redirected to their profile page, but you will now have the option to follow the user. You can only chat with a person if you follow them (more in the collab section).

- Search:
    After you are done exploring the videos and profiles on the homepage, you can move over to the search feature which is similar to the homepage, but now you can refine the videos by the specific genre you want to see. All of the videos will have the same features as the homepage videos.

- Playlists:
    After you are done searching for specific videos and following different dancers, you can move onto to the playlist feature where you can see the videos that you added to specific playlists. You can also remove videos in your playlists by clicking on the "Remove from Playlist" button.

- Collab
    Now you have finished exploring videos, following profiles, and creating playlists, so you can move onto the collab feature where you can talk with the dancers you follow (only the ones you follow). Make sure you enter the same name from your profile (Captilization and all), so the person you are messaging knows who you are.

- Messages
    After you send your message, head on over to your messages tab to see the message you sent and any responses.

- Share:
    Finally after you are done with exploring videos, following profiles, and creating playlists, and messaging other dancers, you can upload your own videos in the share tab. The site only accepts embeded youtube links, so make sure you upload your video to youtube, press the share button, press embed, and copy and paste the link that contains the words "embed". Here's an example: https://www.youtube.com/embed/xshq2zZLbi0?si=EbF5yB6hgnbCwtHK. Once you copy a paste and link, make sure you specify the dance's genre, then upload! You will be redirected to your profile where you can see the videos that you uploaded.

    I hope this site makes it easier for you to communicate with dancers around the world! Here is my video: https://youtu.be/WY45Ciccrko
